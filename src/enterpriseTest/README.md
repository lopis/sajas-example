In this example, N buyers and N sellers engage in negotiation.
Buyers desire to aquire a certain type of goods.
Sellers provide a certain type of goods. Each type os good they sell is registered as a service in the DF.
The Computational Trust agent maintains a record of the behaviour of all agents, provided by the Monitor.
Buyers provide the monitor with their decision of paying or not paying for goods.
Sellers provide the Monitor with their decision of supplying the buyer or not.
The Monitor informs the CT agent, who then calculates an update for the trust value of that agent.
Some agents request the CT agent with trust information on other sellers before engaging in negotiation.
Agents have a varying probability of refusing to perform their task.

The goal this example is to analyse the emergent behaviour of the contract net.
It is expected that Agents who make use of the CT information have better odds at a successful negotiation.
It is also expected that Agents who frequently fail to perform their task, stop aving any business done.
This test is not intended to evaluate the performance of the application, but to show the use of SAJaS in a more complex scenario using different protocols.
